# whatver

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40mstssk%2Fwhatver.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40mstssk%2Fwhatver)

What is the version of this command?

## Usage

```sh
$ npm i -g @mstssk/whatver
$ whatver git
git version 2.21.0
$ wv git # shorthand
git version 2.21.0
```

OR

```sh
$ npx @mstssk/whatver git
npx: installed 1 in 1.336s
git version 2.19.1
```

## Motivation

There are many commands, and have options to show versions each other.
However these options are not same and have many variations.
We don't want to take care about "what a option is to show version for this command?"
